# Windows Beep
This single CPP source file uses windows header (**windows.h**) to access **Beep** and **Sleep** functions which is used to create a set of songs for you to test your motherboard internal speakers.
I created a blog post explaining how to get those speakers back to work again starting from Windows XP 64-bit edition to Windows 10, You can find it [here](https://xen-e.github.io/2022/05/16/windows-beep.html).

## Usage
```bash
beep test1
beep test2
beep test3
beep help
```
**beep** = *beep.exe* or the executable that is produced by the compiler.
